# Data generator service

## WIP

### About
An assignment for a job opening.  
Generator is from https://github.com/viriciti/example-application  
Starts on a random port and sets that port in a mongo db *services* collection  
This way we can connect to this service from another service

### TODO
- Seperate registry service with easy instance subscription and health/alive checks

### Installation
- `npm install`
- `gulp`
- `localhost:3000`
