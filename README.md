# Data generator service

## WIP

### About
An assignment for a job opening.  
Generator is from https://github.com/viriciti/example-application.  
Starts on a random port and registers with a service registry.  
https://github.com/stofstik/service-registry  
This way we can connect to this service from another service without having to know the port.

### Installation
- `npm install -g gulp`
- `npm install`
- `gulp`
- `localhost:3000`

Make sure you have https://github.com/stofstik/service-registry running.
